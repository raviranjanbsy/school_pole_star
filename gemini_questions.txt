How do I implement a "Forgot Password" feature using Firebase Authentication?


Firebase Project Setup:
Make sure you have a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/project/school-mang-ivar/.
Enable Authentication: In the Firebase console, go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable "Email/Password".
Enable Firestore: Go to "Firestore Database" -> "Create database". Choose "Start in test mode" for now (for easier development, but change security rules for production). Select a region.
Enable Storage: Go to "Storage" -> "Get started". Set up the default bucket.
Firebase Configuration in Flutter:
Ensure you've run flutterfire configure and have the firebase_options.dart file in your lib folder.
In your main.dart, make sure Firebase.initializeApp() is called, preferably with options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform, if you're using firebase_options.dart.
Storage Rules (Firebase Console -> Storage -> Rules): A basic rule to allow authenticated users to write to a user-specific folder for their profile images:


rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow writes to a user-specific path if the user is authenticated
    // and the path matches their UID.
    match /user_profile_images/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Or more specific read rules
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow user to create their own profile document using their UID as doc ID
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Or: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // For future profile edits
    }
  }
}


// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBDNV7CbHTaIbkQ2hi0Jwk0HZCq5IrdsIw",
  authDomain: "school-mang-ivar.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "school-mang-ivar",
  storageBucket: "school-mang-ivar.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "1087394897321",
  appId: "1:1087394897321:web:5d01459436b695fc3578b8"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);



══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during layout:
A RenderFlex overflowed by 235 pixels on the bottom.

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  Column
  Column:file:///D:/work/flutter/Sample_app/Flutter-School-Management-System-main/flutter/school_management/lib/adminpane  l.dart:552:13

To inspect this widget in Flutter DevTools, visit:

The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.
The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
like a ListView.
The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#37b27 relayoutBoundary=up1 OVERFLOWING:

=========================================================
Set FCM Server Key: In lib/services/notification_service.dart, you must replace 'YOUR_FCM_SERVER_KEY' with your actual Server Key from the Firebase Console (Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > Manage API in Google Cloud Console).
Security: Storing your FCM server key in the client-side code is insecure. For a production application, you should create a Cloud Function that your app calls, and the Cloud Function will securely send the notification.
================================================================
Firebase database for notification using google server:

npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init functions
cd functions
npm install firebase-admin firebase-functions
Step 3: Write the Cloud Function
Now, open the functions/index.js file and replace its contents with the following code. This function will trigger whenever a new "announcement" is created in your Realtime Database.

functions/index.js

javascript
/**
 * Import and initialize the Firebase Admin SDK.
 */
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const admin = require("firebase-admin");

admin.initializeApp();

/**
 * Cloud Function that triggers when a new announcement is created in the
 * Realtime Database at `/announcements/{pushId}`.
 */
exports.sendAnnouncementNotification = functions.database
  .ref("/announcements/{pushId}")
  .onCreate(async (snapshot, context) => {
    // Get the data for the new announcement
    const announcement = snapshot.val();

    const { title, body, topic, fcmToken } = announcement;

    // Validate the announcement data
    if (!title || !body) {
      console.log("Announcement is missing a title or body, exiting.");
      return null;
    }

    // Construct the FCM payload
    const payload = {
      notification: {
        title: title,
        body: body,
        sound: "default",
      },
      // This data is what your Flutter app receives when a notification is tapped
      data: {
        click_action: "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK",
        // You can add any other custom data you need in the app
        // e.g., 'screen': '/announcements'
      },
    };

    try {
      if (topic) {
        // Send a notification to a specific topic
        console.log(`Sending notification to topic: ${topic}`);
        await admin.messaging().sendToTopic(topic, payload);
      } else if (fcmToken) {
        // Send a notification to a specific device
        console.log(`Sending notification to token: ${fcmToken}`);
        await admin.messaging().sendToDevice(fcmToken, payload);
      } else {
        console.log(
          "No topic or fcmToken provided. Cannot send notification."
        );
        return null;
      }

      console.log("Notification sent successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error sending notification:", error);
    }

    // Clean up the announcement from the database after sending
    // to prevent re-triggering on function restarts.
    return snapshot.ref.remove();
  });
  
Step 4: Deploy the Function
Go back to your terminal (make sure you are in the functions directory or project root) and deploy the function.

bash
firebase deploy --only functions
Step 5: Trigger the Function From Your Flutter App
Now, you need to modify your Flutter app. Instead of using your NotificationService to send the announcement directly, you will simply write a new record to the /announcements path in your Realtime Database. The Cloud Function will automatically take care of the rest.

Here is an example of what the new _sendAnnouncement logic might look like in communication_page.dart.

Example modification in lib/ui/communication_page.dart:

You would need to add a dependency for firebase_database and replace the notification sending logic.

dart
// ... other imports
import 'package:firebase_database/firebase_database.dart';

// ... inside _CommunicationPageState

  Future<void> _sendAnnouncement() async {
    if (!_formKey.currentState!.validate() || _selectedRecipients.isEmpty) {
      // ... (existing validation logic)
      return;
    }

    setState(() => _isSending = true);

    final title = _titleController.text;
    final message = _messageController.text;
    final dbRef = FirebaseDatabase.instance.ref('announcements');

    List<String> successfulWrites = [];
    List<String> failedWrites = [];

    for (final recipient in _selectedRecipients) {
      String recipientName = 'Unknown';
      try {
        final newAnnouncementRef = dbRef.push(); // Create a new unique key
        Map<String, dynamic> announcementData = {
          'title': title,
          'body': message,
          'timestamp': ServerValue.timestamp, // Good practice to add a timestamp
        };

        final topic = _mapRecipientToTopic(recipient);
        if (topic.startsWith('user_') && recipient is Alluser && recipient.fcmToken != null) {
          announcementData['fcmToken'] = recipient.fcmToken;
          recipientName = recipient.name;
        } else if (topic != 'unknown') {
          announcementData['topic'] = topic;
           if (recipient is String) {
            recipientName = recipient;
          } else if (recipient is SchoolClass) {
            recipientName = recipient.className;
          }
        } else {
           throw Exception('Unknown recipient type');
        }

        await newAnnouncementRef.set(announcementData);
        successfulWrites.add(recipientName);

      } catch (e) {
        failedWrites.add(recipientName);
        developer.log(
          'Failed to write announcement for $recipientName: $e',
          name: 'CommunicationPage._sendAnnouncement',
        );
      }
    }

    if (!mounted) return;

    // ... (rest of your UI update logic for showing snackbar and resetting form)
    setState(() => _isSending = false);
  }

Of course. I've analyzed the provided files, focusing on the architecture and implementation of your FeeManagementPage.

This is a very comprehensive and feature-rich screen. You've successfully implemented a wide range of functionalities, from data display and complex filtering to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various data models. The recent refactoring to extract UI components into smaller, dedicated widgets (InvoiceList, FeeCategoryList, etc.) is an excellent step that has significantly improved the code's organization and readability.

Here is a detailed analysis of the current architecture and its components.

Architectural Analysis
The current architecture is centered around a very large and capable StatefulWidget (_FeeManagementPageState). This is a common and practical approach in Flutter, but it has trade-offs that you are beginning to address.

The "Smart UI" / "God Object" Pattern:

What it is: Your _FeeManagementPageState acts as the single source of truth and the central controller for this entire feature. It fetches data, manages UI state (loading, selection mode, pagination), handles user input, and contains all the business logic for filtering, sorting, and interacting with the AuthService.
Strengths:
Colocation: All related logic is in one file, which can make it easy to find and modify things when the feature is small.
Simplicity: It uses the fundamental StatefulWidget and setState pattern, which is easy to understand.
Weaknesses (and areas for improvement):
Maintainability: At over 1000 lines, the State class is becoming difficult to navigate. As more features are added, its complexity will grow, making it harder to debug and reason about.
Testability: It's very difficult to write unit tests for methods like _applyInvoiceFilter or _manageInvoicePayment in isolation because they are tightly coupled to the State class and the Flutter framework (BuildContext, setState).
Reusability: The business logic is not reusable. If another part of your app needed to display a list of overdue invoices, you would have to duplicate the filtering and fetching logic.
Inefficient Rebuilds: A single setState call can trigger a rebuild of the entire widget tree, even if only a small piece of state (like the current page number) has changed. While Flutter is efficient, this can lead to performance issues in very complex UIs.
Code and Component Analysis
fee_management_page.dart (The Conductor):

State Management: You are managing all state manually with variables like _isLoading, _allInvoices, _currentPage, _selectedAcademicYear, etc. This is functional but verbose.
Data Fetching (_loadData): The use of Future.wait is excellent for fetching all initial data concurrently. The try/catch/finally block correctly handles loading and error states.
Business Logic (_applyInvoiceFilter): This method is the core of your client-side logic. The refactoring to use pre-computed maps (_studentMap, _feeStructureMap) and chained iterables (.where()) is a significant performance improvement over nested loops.
UI Composition (build method): The build method is now very clean and declarative. It reads like a table of contents for your page, delegating the actual rendering to specialized child widgets. This is a fantastic result of your recent refactoring.
Component Widgets (InvoiceList, FeeCategoryList, etc.):

These are excellent examples of "dumb" presentation components. They receive data and callbacks (onEdit, onDelete) and are only concerned with how to display that data. They have no business logic of their own, which makes them highly reusable and easy to test visually.
The Path Forward (pubspec.yaml and Provider files):

The presence of flutter_riverpod, riverpod_annotation, and the providers directory clearly indicates the intended architectural direction. You are setting the stage to migrate from the StatefulWidget pattern to a more scalable state management solution with Riverpod.
The fee_management_provider.dart file, with its FeeManagementState and FeeManagementNotifier, is the skeleton for your new architecture. The goal is to move all the state variables and methods from _FeeManagementPageState into this FeeManagementNotifier.
Conclusion and Next Steps
You have built a robust and feature-complete page. The recent componentization has dramatically improved its structure. The current architecture, while functional, has reached the limits of the StatefulWidget pattern in terms of scalability and testability.

The most impactful next step is to complete the refactoring to Riverpod. This will solve the core architectural weaknesses by decoupling your business logic from your UI.

I have prepared the necessary changes to complete this refactoring. This will involve:

Finishing the implementation of the FeeManagementNotifier.
Transforming FeeManagementPage from a StatefulWidget to a ConsumerWidget that consumes the state from the notifier.
Updating the component widgets to receive data and call methods from the Riverpod provider.
Here are the code changes to achieve this.

1. Update pubspec.yaml for Code Generation
To use Riverpod's code generator, you need to add build_runner and riverpod_generator to your dev_dependencies.

High-Level Explanation
This page serves as the central control panel for a school administrator to handle finances. It's a "God Object" in the sense that it manages a wide array of features in a single, large StatefulWidget.

Its primary responsibilities are:

Displaying Data: It fetches and displays four main types of related information: Fee Categories, Fee Structures, Invoices, and a financial Summary.
CRUD Operations: It allows the administrator to Create, Read, Update, and Delete fee categories and structures.
Invoice Management: It provides tools to generate both single and batch invoices for students.
Payment Processing: It has a detailed system for recording and tracking full or partial payments against each invoice.
Powerful Filtering & Sorting: It gives the user robust tools to search, filter (by academic year, fee type), and sort the invoice list to easily find information.
Bulk Actions: It allows selecting multiple invoices at once to perform actions, like marking them all as paid.
How the Code Works: A Deeper Dive
The logic is contained within the _FeeManagementPageState class.

1. State Management
The widget holds all of its data and UI state in local variables. This is a classic StatefulWidget approach.

Data Lists: _feeCategories, _feeStructures, _allInvoices, _students, etc., hold the data fetched from the backend. _allInvoices is the master list, while _invoices is the filtered, sorted, and paginated list that is actually displayed.
UI State: Variables like _isLoading, _error, _isSelectionMode, and _selectedInvoiceIds control what the user sees (e.g., a loading spinner, an error message, or the bulk-action app bar).
Filter/Sort State: _selectedAcademicYear, _selectedFeeCategoryFilter, _searchQuery, and _selectedSortOption store the user's current filter and sort preferences.
2. Data Flow and Logic
The core logic revolves around fetching data and then applying filters to it on the client side.

Initial Load (_loadData): When the page first opens, _loadData is called. It uses Future.wait to efficiently fetch all necessary data from the AuthService at the same time. Once complete, it calls setState to store the data and trigger a UI rebuild.
Filtering (_applyInvoiceFilter): This is the heart of the page's logic. Whenever a user changes a filter, sort option, or search term, this method is called. It takes the master _allInvoices list and applies the selected filters (academic year, category, search query) one by one to produce a new, smaller list. It then sorts this list and finally applies pagination to get the small chunk of invoices for the current page.
UI Rendering (build method): The build method is the entry point for rendering the UI. It's kept clean by delegating the creation of complex UI sections to helper methods like:
_buildInvoiceSummaryCard(): Calculates and displays the financial summary.
_buildBody(): Lays out all the main components (summary, lists, filters).
_buildPaginationControls(): Shows the "next/previous page" buttons.
_buildDefaultAppBar() and _buildSelectionAppBar(): Switch the app bar based on whether the user is in "selection mode".
3. User Actions (Dialogs and Service Calls)
Almost every action that modifies data (create, update, delete, pay) follows the same pattern:

An onPressed callback calls a method like _addFeeCategory() or _manageInvoicePayment().
This method uses showDialog to display a form to the user.
If the user confirms the action, the dialog returns the new or updated data.
The method then calls the appropriate AuthService function (e.g., _authService.createFeeCategory(result)).
Finally, it calls _loadData() again to refresh the entire page with the latest data from the server and shows a SnackBar to confirm the action was successful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
High-Level Analysis
State Management & Architecture:

The page is currently implemented as a very large StatefulWidget. This pattern, sometimes called a "God Object," concentrates a vast amount of UI code, data fetching logic, and business rules in one place. This can make the code harder to read, debug, and maintain over time.
Recommendation: Since your project already has flutter_riverpod as a dependency, I highly recommend refactoring this page to leverage it. You could create Providers to fetch data and a central NotifierProvider (like AsyncNotifier) to manage the state (filters, sorting, search queries). This would beautifully separate your business logic from your UI code, leading to a much cleaner and more testable architecture.
Data Fetching & Performance:

The page currently fetches all invoices, students, and fee structures at once in the _loadData method. While this works for smaller datasets, it won't scale well. As your school grows, fetching thousands of records at once will lead to slow load times and high memory consumption.
Recommendation: For better scalability, consider implementing server-side filtering, sorting, and pagination. Your AuthService methods (e.g., fetchAllInvoices) could be modified to accept parameters like page number, items per page, and filter criteria, so the database does the heavy lifting.
Code Organization:

At over 1700 lines, the file is quite large. It can be beneficial to break it down into smaller, more manageable components.
Recommendation: You could extract major UI sections into their own widgets. For example:
_buildInvoiceSummaryCard() -> InvoiceSummaryCard(invoices: ...)
The ListView.builder for Fee Categories -> FeeCategoryList(categories: ...)
The filter and sort dropdowns -> InvoiceFilterControls(...)
This makes the main build method much shorter and easier to understand.

GitHub Pages (Free and Easy for Static Sites)
GitHub Pages is a great free option for hosting static websites directly from your GitHub repository.

Steps:

Create a GitHub repository: If you don't have one, create a new public repository on GitHub for your Flutter project.

Build your Flutter web app:

Bash

flutter build web --release --base-href="/your-repo-name/"
flutter build web --release --base-href="/school_management_1/"
Important: The --base-href flag is crucial for GitHub Pages because your app will be served from a sub-path (e.g., username.github.io/your-repo-name/). Replace /your-repo-name/ with the actual name of your GitHub repository.

Push your build/web content to a gh-pages branch:

Go into your build/web directory: cd build/web

Initialize a new git repository there:

flutter build web --release --base-href="/school_management_1/"

flutter build web --release --base-href="/school_web_page/"


 git init

 git add .

 git commit -m "19_07"


git branch -M gh-pages-19_07

git remote add origin https://github.com/raviranjanbsy/school_management_1.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/raviranjanbsy/school_management_borqs.git
git push -u origin gh-pages-19_07

(Replace your-username and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub details.)

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your GitHub repository on the website.

Navigate to Settings > Pages.

Under "Source," select the gh-pages branch and click Save.

GitHub will provide you with the public URL for your application (e.g., https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/).


git remote add origin https://github.com/raviranjanbsy/school_web_page.git

Of course! Integrating a real payment gateway like Stripe or Razorpay is a critical step to move from a mock payment system to a production-ready application. I'll guide you through integrating Stripe, as it's a popular and well-supported choice. The principles will be very similar for other providers like Razorpay.

For security, we'll use a server-side approach with Firebase Cloud Functions. This ensures your secret API keys are never exposed in the client-side Flutter app.

Here’s a complete, step-by-step guide to integrating Stripe payments.

Step 1: Backend Setup (Firebase Cloud Function)
First, we need a secure backend endpoint to create a "Payment Intent" from Stripe. This intent represents a payment session.

Set up your Cloud Functions environment if you haven't already by running firebase init functions in your project root. Choose TypeScript or JavaScript (this example uses JavaScript).

Install dependencies for your function by running this command inside the functions directory:

bash
npm install stripe firebase-admin firebase-functions
Set your Stripe secret key in your Firebase environment configuration. This is a secure way to store your key. Replace sk_test_... with your actual Stripe secret key.

bash
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret="sk_test_..."
Create the Cloud Function. Replace the content of functions/index.js with the following code. This function will create a Stripe Payment Intent and send its clientSecret back to your app.

New file: index.js
+60
 Show full code block 
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const admin = require("firebase-admin");

// IMPORTANT: Use Firebase environment configuration to store your secret key.
// Do not hardcode it in your source code.
// Run: firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret="sk_test_..."
const stripe = require("stripe")(functions.config().stripe.secret);

admin.initializeApp();

/**
 * Creates a Stripe Payment Intent.
 *
 * This function must be called by an authenticated user.
 *
 * @param {object} data The data passed to the function.
 * @param {number} data.amount The amount for the payment in the smallest currency unit (e.g., paise/cents).
 * @param {string} data.currency The currency code (e.g., 'inr', 'usd').
 * @param {string} [data.invoiceId] Optional: The ID of the invoice being paid.
 * @param {object} context The context of the function call.
 * @returns {Promise<{clientSecret: string}>} An object containing the client secret for the Payment Intent.
 */
exports.createPaymentIntent = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // 1. Ensure the user is authenticated.
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
      "unauthenticated",
      "The function must be called while authenticated."
    );
  }

  const { amount, currency, invoiceId } = data;

  // 2. Validate the input data.
  if (!Number.isInteger(amount) || amount <= 0 || !currency) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
      "invalid-argument",
      "The function must be called with a positive integer 'amount' and a 'currency' string."
    );
  }

  try {
    // 3. Create a Payment Intent with the order amount and currency.
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: amount,
      currency: currency,
      automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true },
      metadata: {
        userId: context.auth.uid,
        invoiceId: invoiceId || "N/A",
      },
    });

    // 4. Send the client secret back to the client.
    return { clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Stripe Error:", error);
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError("internal", "Unable to create payment intent.");
  }
});
Deploy the function to Firebase:

bash
firebase deploy --only functions
Step 2: Frontend Setup (Flutter)
Now, let's configure your Flutter app to communicate with Stripe and our new Cloud Function.

Add the flutter_stripe package to your pubspec.yaml:

pubspec.yaml
The code change produced by Gemini cannot be automatically applied. You can manually apply the change or ask Gemini to try again.
cached_network_image: ^3.3.1 # Add cached_network_image shimmer: ^3.0.0 # Or latest version intl: ^0.19.0 # Or latest version

flutter_stripe: ^10.1.1 # Add Stripe for payments equatable: ^2.0.5 # For value equality in models cloud_functions: ^4.7.0 # For calling Cloud Functions table_calendar: ^3.1.1 # For calendar view
plaintext

Initialize Stripe in your app. This is best done in your main.dart file. Replace the placeholder with your publishable key from the Stripe dashboard.

New file: main.dart

 Show full code block 
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';
import 'package:school_management/ui/my_invoices_page.dart';

// Your Firebase options file, generated by `flutterfire configure`
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter bindings are initialized
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );

  // Set your Stripe publishable key.
  // IMPORTANT: This is a public key. Your SECRET key must only be on the server.
  Stripe.publishableKey = 'pk_test_...'; // <-- REPLACE WITH YOUR PUBLISHABLE KEY

  runApp(
    const ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'School Management',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        fontFamily: 'Poppins',
      ),
      home: const MyInvoicesPage(),
    );
  }
}
Step 3: Integrating the Payment Flow
Let's update your providers and UI to handle the payment process.

Update InvoiceService to include a method that calls our new Cloud Function.

invoice_provider.dart
-0
+18
 Show full code block 
import 'package:firebase_database/firebase_database.dart';
import 'package:cloud_functions/cloud_functions.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:school_management/model_class/invoice.dart';
import 'package:school_management/providers/auth_provider.dart';
      'amountPaid': amountPaid,
      'paymentDate': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
    });
  }

  Future<String> createPaymentIntent({
    required double amount,
    required String currency,
    String? invoiceId,
  }) async {
    final callable =
        FirebaseFunctions.instance.httpsCallable('createPaymentIntent');
    final response = await callable.call<Map<String, dynamic>>({
      // Stripe expects the amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents/paise).
      'amount': (amount * 100).toInt(),
      'currency': currency,
      'invoiceId': invoiceId,
    });

    return response.data['clientSecret'] as String;
}
}

Update my_invoices_page.dart to use the Stripe payment sheet, replacing the mock logic. We'll refactor the payment handling for better clarity and error management.

npm install stripe firebase-admin firebase-functions 

firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret="sk_test_..."

PS D:\work\flutter\Sample_app\Flutter-School-Management-System-main\flutter\school_management> firebase deploy --only functions

Error: Cannot understand what targets to deploy/serve. No targets in firebase.json match '--only functions'. If you are using PowerShell make sure you place quotes around any comma-separated lists (ex: --only "functions,firestore").

you can design a similar assignments page in Flutter (excluding any comments about profile pictures):

1. AppBar and Logo
Use an AppBar with a leading logo (use Image.asset() or Image.network() as appropriate).

      fileName: "Asset Exam Practice...",
    ),
    // Add more AssignmentCard widgets as needed
  ]

3. Assignment Card Widget
Create a reusable widget for each assignment:

class AssignmentCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String subject, date, title, submissionDate, fileName;

  const AssignmentCard({
    required this.subject,
    required this.date,
    required this.title,
    required this.submissionDate,
    required this.fileName,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      margin: EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 15),
      shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12)),
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(12.0),
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            Row(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.edit, color: Colors.orange, size: 36),
                SizedBox(width: 12),
                Expanded(
                  child: Column(
                    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                    children: [
                      Text(
                        "ASSIGNMENT | $subject | $date",
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, color: Colors.grey),
                      ),
                      SizedBox(height: 4),
                      Text(
                        title,
                        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, color: Colors.orange[700], fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 12),
            Text(
              "Submission date: $submissionDate",
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 13, color: Colors.black87),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 8),
            Row(
              children: [
                Icon(Icons.picture_as_pdf, color: Colors.red),
                SizedBox(width: 8),
                Expanded(
                  child: Text(
                    fileName,
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 14, color: Colors.black),
                    overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
                  ),
                ),
                Icon(Icons.attach_file, color: Colors.grey),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

4. Bottom Navigation Bar
Use BottomNavigationBar for navigation:
BottomNavigationBar(
  items: [
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.person),
      label: 'Profile',
    ),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.home),
      label: 'Home',
    ),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.dashboard),
      label: 'Module',
    ),
  ],
  currentIndex: 1, // Set based on selected tab
  onTap: (index) {
    // Handle navigation
  },
)

To recap, we:

Set up the Flutter app to request notification permissions.
Ensured the app saves the device's FCM token to the database on login.
Created and deployed a Cloud Function to listen for new posts.
Debugged and fixed several issues, including:
Incorrect Cloud Function triggers.
Missing fcmToken lookups.
Outdated SDKs causing API errors.
A breaking change in the firebase-admin SDK.
You now have a fully functional notification system for your announcements and assignments.
